# Code School's Soup to Bits Exercise for NodeJS

This repo contains all the source code for the application built in Code School's Soup to Bits video following completion of the [**Real-Time Web with NodeJS** course](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-node-js).

The course notes markdown file consists of all the notes I took throughout the course and video. 

Buyer beware: There are some discrepancies between the final version of the code on the codeschool GitHub repos (linked to in the course notes) and the code that was written in the Soup to Bits video, but I tried to capture the explanations and rationales as well as I could for reference.
